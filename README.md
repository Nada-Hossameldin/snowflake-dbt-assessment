# snowflake-dbt-assessment

This repo contains a dbt project that reads Snowflake "TPCH sample data" and builds models across staging (silver) and marts (gold) layers.

## Models

### stg_orders (silver)
- Sources data from `orders` and `customer` tables.
- Adds `customer_name`.
- Derives `order_year` (from `o_orderdate`).
- Keeps `total_price` column.
- Tested for "unique + not null" on `o_orderkey`.

### customer_revenue (gold)
- Joins `orders` and `lineitem`.
- Computes total revenue per customer:
  ```sql
  SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount))
````

* Groups by `c_custkey` and includes `customer_name`.
* Tested for "not null" on primary key.

### customer\_revenue\_by\_year (gold)

* Aggregates yearly revenue per customer (`order_year`).
* Demonstrates grouping by both customer and year.

## How to Run

### 1. Snowflake setup

Ensure you have a warehouse `DEV_WH`, database `MAIDSCC_DB`, and schema `ANALYTICS`. Example:

```sql
CREATE WAREHOUSE DEV_WH WITH WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'XSMALL' AUTO_SUSPEND = 60 AUTO_RESUME = TRUE;
CREATE DATABASE MAIDSCC_DB;
CREATE SCHEMA MAIDSCC_DB.ANALYTICS;
```

### 2. Configure dbt profile

Add to `~/.dbt/profiles.yml`:

```yaml
snowflake_tpch_demo:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: snowflake
      account: RQXDWNP-QC05241
      user: <YOUR_USER>
      password: <YOUR_PASSWORD>
      role: ACCOUNTADMIN
      database: MAIDSCC_DB
      warehouse: DEV_WH
      schema: ANALYTICS
      threads: 4
```

### 3. Install dbt

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install dbt-core dbt-snowflake
```

### 4. Run dbt

```bash
dbt debug
dbt deps
dbt run
dbt test
dbt docs generate
dbt docs serve
```

> Note: The interactive documentation opened by `dbt docs serve` runs locally on your machine at `http://localhost:8080`. Anyone cloning this repo will need to run `dbt docs serve` themselves to access the docs.

## Deliverables

**Models:**

* `models/staging/stg_orders.sql`
* `models/marts/customer_revenue.sql`
* `models/marts/customer_revenue_by_year.sql`

**Sources & Tests:** `models/schema.yml`

**Sources:** `customer`, `orders`, `lineitem`
**Tests:**

* `unique + not_null` on `o_orderkey`
* `not_null` on `c_custkey`
* Referential integrity: `orders.c_custkey` â†’ `customer.c_custkey`

---

## Enhancements

* Referential integrity tests between customers and orders.
* dbt Cloud job scheduling (optional): configure a daily run job to keep models refreshed.

---

## Assumptions

* Snowflake account: `RQXDWNP-QC05241`
* Target DB/schema: `MAIDSCC_DB.ANALYTICS`
* Warehouse: `DEV_WH`

```

This version explicitly tells the assessor how they can view your documentation and keeps all deliverables, tests, and enhancements clearly listed.  

If you want, I can also **add a short section showing how to see the dbt exposures** so your optional enhancements are fully represented in the README. Do you want me to do that?
